<h2 id="INTRODUCTIONA">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HIS</span> small portrait gallery of British generals represents,
in fair epitome, the drama of British history. Each of the
officers who figure here has behind him a varied story of
fighting in strange places, under all sorts of conditions, as
well as in the tense atmosphere of modern scientific war; each of them
has first had to struggle against heavy odds before arriving at the
conditions which at present obtain on the Western front. Infantrymen,
cavalrymen, artillerists, they have come through a fiery trial to command
large bodies of troops in the most terrible struggle of our history.</p>

<p>The part of their story that is concerned in this war is memorable,
and may we not say it, memorably fine? For these are not the leaders
of that vast host whose shadow has hung over Europe for so many years,
whose numbers and efficiency have been the evil dream of the international
situation; but of that small contingent that, for an ideal, took the field
light-heartedly, against the vast German horde. Even the Belgian army
was more numerous than the Expeditionary Force that struck its first
blow before Mons; and these leaders have memories of the days when
it was the equal in nothing, save undaunted courage and tactical ability,
of the army in whose path it stood.</p>

<p>They have seen every type of fighting. The war of movements
with its swift changes and long hazards was their first experience, an
experience that none of those who took part in it will ever forget. For
some terrible days the British army stood between the Allies and
disaster; but the experience it bought was handed on to the enemy in a
series of engagements, the lesson of which he softens by proclaiming the
first seven divisions to have been unique. The admission is sufficiently
revealing, for the handful of troops ought to have been crushed at Mons;
or, escaping thence, should have been penned into Maubeuge; or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
evading that trap, should have met annihilation at Le Cateau. But
they fought coolly, were man&oelig;uvred skilfully, saving themselves by sheer
fighting ability from the tide which threatened to overwhelm them.</p>

<p>Only consummate leaders could have taken an army to the Marne.
The army ought to have been wiped out long before. The Germans had
fully resolved upon it, they had the men and guns to encompass it, their
long-perfected plans depended upon it. The British, wearied by the
pressure of a hurried retreat, fought almost without cover against a great
concentration of guns. But not only did they fight with superb spirit;
they fought also with that instinctive appreciation of tactics which comes
from perfectly assimilated experience. When the German blow had over
reached itself, the British Generals were able to advance, threaten the left
wing of Von Kluck's army when his right was dealing with General
Manoury's outflanking movement on the Ourcq, outman&oelig;uvre and outfight
the enemy on the Aisne and secure tactical advantages of the first
importance. In the victory of the Marne not the least wonderful of
many arresting features was this effective recoil of the army which the
Germans had announced to be "dispersed" ten days before.</p>

<p>After the battle of the Aisne, the army, moved <i>en bloc</i> from the
heart of France, where the war of positions was beginning to develop,
appeared on the extreme left flank of the Allied forces, man&oelig;uvring
towards the East in the effort to outflank the Germans. Here, out of a
struggle of cross-purposes, there emerged, little by little, the outlines of
a titanic battle for the possession of the Channel coast. The Belgian
army had fallen back from Antwerp upon the sea, covered by an army
corps pushed from the coast in a precarious venture towards Bruges
and Ghent; and the handful of British divisions stood between the
picked troops of the Germans and the goal they had failed to value
before it was lost. Many of these generals tasted the bitter savour
of those days when it seemed impossible that flesh and blood
could withstand the unceasing onslaught of ever fresh troops&mdash;of the
Bavarians, the Guard, and picked Prussian regiments&mdash;and of the pounding
of an overwhelming weight of metal. German critics have said
that this army was one of non-commissioned officers, and certainly not
even the racial stubbornness could have saved the situation if it had
not been wedded to high ability, if undaunted courage had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
equalled by the resolute skill of the command. The first battle of
Ypres was the first in which the Germans and the British fought <i>à outrance</i>,
and no one to-day is ignorant of the result. The Germans broke off
the engagement and thereby acknowledged their defeat. The British
had not turned the line. That was impossible with their resources.
But they had held the Germans off from their goal and inflicted upon
them one of the bloodiest defeats in history.</p>

<p>Henceforward the war presented a different problem to the command.
The last battle of the war of movements on the Western front had been
fought for the time being and the war of positions held sway. In the
months that followed, Britain had to build up an army commensurate
with the task she had assumed. For every soldier of the pre-war army
she had to find about ten, and her generals had to teach the new armies
their business. The action of Neuve Chapelle showed the British
army making its <i>début</i> in one of those carefully-planned limited attacks
against entrenched positions which have been developed, with growing
experience, out of all recognition. Loos was a more ambitious venture.
In it there appeared volunteer troops to astound seasoned veterans by
their dash and discipline. But the lessons of Neuve Chapelle had not
been perfectly digested and too much was attempted. The result, in
its larger aspect, was less achievement than the promise of overwhelming
success in the future. In these two battles the British commanders
firmly grasped the elements of the problem that confronted them, and
proved the worth of the new Armies. They were to apply this knowledge
in the most mighty battle the world has seen.</p>

<p>It was the battle of the Somme that first revealed the true formidableness
of the new British armies. The opening of this terrific campaign
was pitched for the fifth month of the Verdun struggle. The offensive
against modern entrenchments seemed to be in eclipse. Four months'
pounding by the seried masses of the German guns and carefully
arranged assaults by picked troops had failed to reach the enemy objective.
The deduction that seemed inevitable was that the offensive was bound
to be extremely costly and productive of little. It was in this atmosphere
the Somme battle opened against positions that had been elaborated
by two years of care and cunning. The course of that bitterly contested
campaign re-established the offensive as a paying proposition. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
manner of engagements were fought out in that area. Some positions
were carried at the point of the bayonet. Others were encircled so that
the garrisons had to evacuate them or choose between annihilation and
capture. But, by whatever means, one fell after another. The experience
gained was assimilated and the armies marched from strength to strength.
On at least one occasion the British were only cheated of a decisive and
overwhelming victory by an unkindly fate that brought bad weather
when the armies were straining to go forward. A flank was opened in
the German lines and through it the German army steadily bled away
until an unwonted prudence conquered Prussian pride and the great
strategic retreat was carried out. By that retreat, carried out under
the compulsion of the British army, the Germans admitted to the world
the strategic nature of the Somme campaign success.</p>

<p>By the retreat the Germans hoped to gain a respite. The victory
of Vimy Ridge was the unwelcome reality to which that dream materialized.
This position was one that was formidable from its natural conformation
to begin with, and it had been turned into an obstacle which
almost justified the German confidence in its impregnability. The
assaulting troops had the advantage of only a limited surprise. The
Ridge overlooked the British positions, and little could be done between
Arras and La Bassée that was not detected by the German observers.
Yet in two days the position was carried with 11,000 prisoners and 100
guns. And it was but three weeks since the enemy had carried out the
retreat that was to cut the ground from under the British plans. The
British losses were comparatively light; everyone could see that if the
battle were to become a precedent, the decisive defeat of Germany
was assured.</p>

<p>Just two months later, the capture of Messines Ridge proved
conclusively that the success could be repeated against another of the
strongest sectors of the line. But the victory on this occasion was
even more remarkable. The position was so advantageous to the
Germans that the enemy troops had been urged to fight to the last. The
ridge overlooked the whole of the Ypres salient which had been held
so staunchly against every handicap. The assault differed greatly from
that on the Vimy Ridge. The tactics were different in detail though the
outlines were the same; but the attack was equally kept under the control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the command and swept forward to a similar success. These two
battles of the 1917 Campaign made it clear that the British had solved
the general problem of the German defensive, and at the same time they
revealed the intimate dependence of victory upon the control of the
commanders. In a war that seemed to be given over to mechanics,
engineering and physics, that was frequently regarded as a mathematical
problem, they showed that leadership is still the paramount factor in the
art of warfare.</p>

<p>Such then is the versatility of these leaders. The war has cast
upon them the burden of meeting every sort of warfare. They have
come triumphantly through the ordeal, winning a grudging praise from
the enemy, and the more unmistakeable approval of attempts at imitation.
They have shown themselves as resourceful in devising new machines
and methods of attack as they are experienced in the orthodox fighting
of other days. The war may have new experiences for them, but it
cannot daunt or check them. They have seen the worst. They have
come through dark places to the approaching light of day. Their record
is our best assurance for the future.</p>

FIELD-MARSHAL SIR DOUGLAS HAIG,
<span class="small">K.T., G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E.</span>, <b>A.D.C.</b></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> DOUGLAS HAIG was born in Fife on June 19th, 1861, of
a family which has played a great part in the annals of the
Scottish Borders. He was educated at Clifton and Brasenose
College, Oxford, of which he is an Honorary Fellow. He is
almost the only great soldier of modern times who has passed through
the curriculum of an English University.</p>

<p>He joined the 7th Hussars in 1885, and, after passing through the
Staff College, served in the Soudan Campaign of 1898, being present
at the Battles of Atbara and Omdurman.</p>

<p>His great military talents were first proved in the South African
War. After acting as D.A.A.G. for the Cavalry in Natal, he became
the Chief Staff officer of General French during the Colesberg operations.
In 1901-2 he commanded a group of columns which did brilliant work,
chiefly in northern Cape Colony, in pursuit of Kritzinger and Scheepers.
His South African record marked him out as an ideal Staff officer, and
thereafter his rise was rapid. From 1903-6 he was Inspector-General
of Cavalry in India with the rank of Major-General. He was Director
of Military Training at home from 1906-7, and Director of Staff
Duties from 1907-9. From 1909-12 he was Chief-of-Staff in India.
From 1912-14 he was G.O.C. at Aldershot, and in 1914, on the
outbreak of the European War, he was given command of the I Corps.</p>

<span class="caption">FIELD-MARSHAL SIR DOUGLAS HAIG</span>
</div>

<p>His record during the European War has been one of incessant
and arduous toil and heavy responsibility. He commanded the I Corps
in the Retreat from Mons, at the Battles of the Marne and of the Aisne,
and on him fell the chief brunt of the German attack in the first Battle
of Ypres. With the First Army, when it was formed, he fought at Neuve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a><br /><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a><br /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Chapelle, Festubert, Givenchy and Loos. In December, 1915, he succeeded
Field-Marshal Lord French as Commander-in-Chief of the
British Forces in the West. Thereafter the record of his doings is the
history of his country. The Somme, the German retreat, the Battle of
Arras, and the victory of the Messines Ridge are part of his achievements
in Supreme Command.</p>

<p>The foremost living British General, and one fit to rank with any
soldier in Europe, is, as Generals go to-day, a young man, only fifty-six.
He is at once a scientific soldier after the most modern plan, and a true
leader of men. Having been a brilliant Staff officer, he has a proper
understanding of the functions of a Staff. Chary of speech, bold in design,
resolute in execution, he raised first his Corps and then his Army to a
foremost place among British forces, and now he has raised the British
Army to a foremost place among the armies of the world. He has the
complete confidence of his men, and has earned the admiration and
affection of all who work with him.</p>

<p>Scotland has given an innumerable host of soldiers to British and
foreign armies, but, with the possible exception of Montrose and Sir
John Moore (if Moore can be counted a Scotsman), there has been none
who stands in the very front rank of the profession of arms. To-day
there is such an one. It has been truly said that the biggest soldiers of all
have not the specific military mind, but have a brain indistinguishable
from the brain which makes a great statesman or any other great man
of action. Sir Douglas Haig, while possessing every technical quality of
a soldier, has the mind as well of a statesman, and of a great captain of
industry. The organisation of modern war, indeed, requires qualities of
which the soldier of other years had no conception. The gigantic industrial
activities behind the British front, on which our fighting line depend,
the gigantic educational schemes necessary to train our new Armies,
demand from the Commander-in-Chief an administrative talent not less
high than that required from a Prime Minister or a Pro-Consul. In
such tasks Sir Douglas Haig has shown himself pre-eminent, and to this
capacity he adds the swiftness in design and precision in performance
of the foremost captains of history. Britain has entrusted her manhood to
one who has nobly justified her confidence.</p>

GENERAL SIR HERBERT CHARLES
ONSLOW PLUMER,
<span class="small">G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., K.C.B.</span>, <b>A.D.C.</b></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> HERBERT PLUMER was born in Devon on March 13th,
1857. In 1876 he entered the York and Lancaster Regiment
and served with it in the Soudan War of 1884. In South Africa,
in 1896, he raised and commanded a corps of mounted rifles
for service in the Matabele rebellion, being mentioned in despatches
and receiving the brevet of Lieut.-Colonel. In the South African War
of 1899-1902 he won his first great reputation in the field. He
commanded the Rhodesian Field Force and was the first British soldier to
cross the enemy frontier.</p>

<p>For months he attempted to reach Mafeking from the north, and,
after the happy relief of that historic town, he was one of the most active
and resolute of column commanders in the Transvaal. This "small,
quiet, resolute man," as a historian describes him, had the power of
enforcing discipline and inspiring confidence in the diverse elements
under him.</p>

<p>In 1902 he became Major-General, and 1908 Lieut.-General.
In 1904-5 he was Q.M.G. to the Forces and Third Military Member of

<p>Sir Herbert Plumer did not appear in the field in the European War
till January, 1915, when he was given command of the new V Corps,
holding the southern side of the Ypres Salient. When General Smith-Dorrien
retired in April of that year from the command of the Second
Army, Sir Herbert succeeded him. It was that Army which fought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a><br /><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a><br /><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Second Battle of Ypres, and has since remained on the left flank of the
British front in the West. It has seen severe fighting, such as the Hooge
battle of August, 1915, the advance at Hooge during the Battle of Loos
in September, 1915, the struggle at the Bluff in the spring of 1916, and
the action of the Canadians at Ypres in June of the same year. The
Ypres Salient has become historic as the most critical part of the
British line.</p>

<p>The Second Army was not engaged during the Battle of the Somme
or the first stages of the Battle of Arras, but on Thursday, June 7th,
1917, attacking on the whole front from the Ypres salient to Ploegsteert
Wood, it carried all its objectives, with the vital Wytschaete-Messines
Ridge, put an end to the embarrassment of the Ypres salient, took over
7,000 prisoners, and accounted for at least 30,000 of the enemy,&mdash;the
whole at a small expense of British lives. The action was probably the
most perfectly planned and executed in the history of the campaign.</p>

<p>Sir Herbert Plumer is the best type of British regular officer, an
enthusiast for the historic traditions of the army, a soldier with wide
experience in many lands and many different forms of campaign. His
patience and stamina and perfect judgment have made him for many
months a brilliant Warden of the Flanders Marches.</p>

GENERAL SIR HENRY SEYMOUR
RAWLINSON, <span class="small">BART., G.C.V.O., K.C.B.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> HENRY RAWLINSON was born on February 20th, 1864;
the eldest son of Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Bart.
He was educated at Eton and Sandhurst, and in February,
1884, entered the 60th Rifles. After acting as A.D.C. for four
years to Lord Roberts, then Commander-in-Chief in India, he served
with the Mounted Infantry in the Burma campaign, 1888. He exchanged
into the Coldstream Guards in 1891, was a Brigade Major at Aldershot
from 1894 to 1896, and served in the Soudan Campaign of 1897-8 as
D.A.A.G. to Lord Kitchener, being present at the Battles of Atbara
and Omdurman. In the South African War he was through the siege of
Ladysmith as A.A.G. to Sir George White, acted as A.A.G. to Lord
Roberts' Army at Headquarters, and commanded with great distinction
a Mobile Column during the last eighteen months of the war. As Column
Commander he was more than once in action against the brilliant soldier
who is now Lieut.-General Smuts. He was Commandant of the Staff
College from 1903-6, commanded the 2nd Brigade at Aldershot 1907-10,
and the 3rd Division at Salisbury Plain 1910-14.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the European War he was given command of
the 4th Division on the Aisne, and was then put in command of the new
IV Corps which included the 7th Division and which landed in Flanders in
the beginning of October, 1914. The exploits of the 7th Division form
one of the most glorious pages in modern British military history. As
all the world knows, it was compelled to fall back with the 3rd Cavalry
Division towards Ypres, and on October 16th held the line east of Ypres
running through Gheluvelt. On the 20th of the month Sir Douglas
Haig's I Corps came into line on its left, and the First Battle of Ypres
began. The story of its desperate fighting for Gheluvelt and then for the
Klein Zillebeke ridge is familiar to all. The best account of the exploits
of the 7th Division is to be found in an order issued by Major-General
Capper who then commanded the Division and was later killed in
action.</p>

<span class="caption">GENERAL SIR HENRY RAWLINSON</span>

<p>"After the deprivations and tensions of being pursued day and night
by an infinitely stronger force, the Division had to pass through the worst
ordeal of all. It was left to a little force of 30,000 to keep the German
army at bay, while the other British Corps were being brought up from
the Aisne. Here they clung like grim death with almost every man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a><br /><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
trench, holding a line which of necessity was a great deal too long&mdash;a thin
exhausted line&mdash;against which the pride of the German first line troops
were hurling themselves with fury. The odds against them were about
eight to one, and, when once the enemy found the range of a trench,
the shells dropped into it from one end to the other with terrible effect.
Yet the men stood firm, and defended Ypres in such a manner that a
German officer afterwards described their action as a brilliant feat of
arms, and said that they were under the impression that there had been
four British Army Corps against them at this point. When the Division
was afterwards withdrawn from the fighting line to refit, it was found
that out of 400 officers who set out from England only 44 were left, and
out of 12,000 men only 2,336."</p>

<p>At the Battle of Neuve Chapelle the IV Corps, including the 7th
and 8th Divisions, attacked on the afternoon of the first day on the left
of the British front and incurred severe losses in that memorable action.
The IV Corps was reconstituted after Neuve Chapelle under Sir Henry
Rawlinson, and its three Divisions, the 1st, 15th, and 47th, played a
conspicuous part in the Battle of Loos in September, 1915. It was
the 15th Division which, it will be remembered, took the village of Loos
and Hill 70, and advanced to the suburbs of Lens&mdash;one of the most
heroic episodes in the whole campaign.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1916 Sir Henry Rawlinson was appointed to the
command of the new Fourth Army, which took its place in the line on
the right of the old Third Army in the Somme area. He was in command
of the whole front when the Battle of the Somme opened on July 1st, 1916.
On the first two days of the battle he commanded the whole of the five
Corps on that front, but handed over the two northern Corps to Sir
Hubert Gough's reserve Fifth Army early in July. The Fourth Army
line then ran southward from Thiepval to the junction with the French
at Maricourt. Under his direction were fought the actions of July 14th
and September 15th and 25th. Few British forces have had a harder
task than to break the mighty defences of Contalmaison, High Wood,
Delville Wood, and Guillemont.</p>

<p>When the German retreat began in the spring of 1917, Sir Henry
Rawlinson led the southern part of the British advance. It was his men
who entered Peronne and fought their way to the gates of St. Quentin.</p>

<p>The Commander of the Fourth Army is one of the most accomplished
and highly trained of modern British Generals. He has mastered the
learning of his profession, and has a perfect understanding of Staff work.
But his knowledge is only a small part of the endowment which he brings
to work in the field. He has that <i>flair</i> for the decisive moment which no
training can give, and his high spirits, stout heart, and steady confidence
in himself and his men have made him an ideal Commander, both for the
tedious war of positions, and any future war of movement.</p>

GENERAL SIR HUBERT DE LA
POER GOUGH, <span class="small">K.C.B., K.C.V.O.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> HUBERT GOUGH was born on August 12th, 1870; the
eldest son of the late Sir Charles John Stanley Gough. He was
educated at Eton and Sandhurst, and, in 1889, obtained a commission
in the 16th Lancers. He served in the Tirah Expedition
and in the South African War. On the outbreak of the European War
he commanded the 3rd Cavalry Brigade during the Retreat from Mons
and the Battle of the Marne. His Brigade was one of the first to arrive
at the Aisne on September 12th, 1914, and, a few weeks later, when the
Cavalry Corps was formed under Sir Edmund Allenby, he was given
command of the 2nd Cavalry Division. His Division was the first part
of the British force to leave on October 3rd for Flanders.</p>

<p>In the First Battle of Ypres, when the small British Army bolted
the door of the North against the German sweep, his Division played
a foremost part. In General Smith-Dorrien's advance towards La Bassée
it moved on the left flank, clearing out the Germans from the forest of
Nieppe, the Hill of Cassel, and Hazebrouck. Along with the 1st Cavalry
Division it reconnoitred the line of the Lys, and later held the front between
Zandvoorde and Messines on the left of Allenby's Corps. In the great
struggle of October 30th and 31st it had desperate fighting to hold the
line, and, on November 1st, before the French XVI Corps arrived in
support, it was forced back from Hollebeke and Messines.</p>

<span class="caption">GENERAL SIR HUBERT GOUGH</span>
</div>

<p>Sir Hubert Gough's 2nd Cavalry Division was at the Battle of
Neuve Chapelle, but failed to get the expected chance of going into action.
Shortly after this he took command of the 7th Infantry Division and was
engaged in the operations at Festubert. About the middle of July, 1915,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he was appointed to command the I Corps in succession to Sir C. Monro,
who went to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>At Loos Sir Hubert Gough commanded this Corps, which contained
at the time the 2nd, 7th and 9th Divisions. It was his men who stormed
Fosse 8 and the Hohenzollern Redoubt.</p>

<p>During the spring of 1916 he was put in command of a Reserve
Army, which at the time consisted chiefly of Cavalry and a Staff.
After the first day of the Battle of the Somme, when it was apparent
that Sir Henry Rawlinson's Fourth Army was engaged on too long a line,
the part of the front from la Boiselle northwards was handed over to the
Reserve Army, which now became known as the Fifth. There, for five
months, Sir Hubert Gough was hotly engaged. It was under his command
that Pozières and Mouquet Farm were taken by the Australians
and Courcelette by the Canadians, and the Thiepval Ridge cleared at
the end of October. His greatest success came in the Battle of the Ancre
on November 13th, when, in two days, he took more than 5,000 German
prisoners.</p>

<p>When the German retreat began in the spring of 1917, Sir Hubert
Gough's Army operated in the Bapaume area and towards the country
between Cambrai and St. Quentin. It was engaged on the right of the
Third Army during the Battle of Arras.</p>

<p>Sir Hubert Gough belongs to one of the most famous of British
fighting families. His brother, Brigadier-General John Gough, V.C.,
was Sir Douglas Haig's Chief-of-Staff during the first nine months of
the war, and died by a chance rifle bullet at Estaires on February 20th,
1917. Sir Hubert, who is only 46, is by far the youngest of British soldiers
in high command&mdash;the youngest Army Commander, indeed, among all
the Allies. He first made his name as a dashing Cavalry leader, a man
of infinite courage and resource in an open campaign. In the long months
of trench fighting he has won a reputation second to no British General
for skill in our modern scientific and mechanical form of warfare. His
energy, his daring, and his boyish good-humour made him an ideal
Cavalry leader, and they have endeared him to every man who has had the
honour to serve under his command. He is not the least notable of the
many great soldiers whom Ireland has given to the British Army.</p>

ALLENBY, <span class="small">K.C.B.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> EDMUND ALLENBY was born on April 23rd, 1861, and
was educated at Haileybury. He entered the Inniskilling
Dragoons, with whom he served in the Bechuanaland Expedition
of 1884-5. He fought in Zululand in 1888, and in the South
African War was a dashing and successful Column Commander. He was
one of those who harried General Delarey in the difficult Magaliesberg
region.</p>

<p>In 1910 he was promoted to the command of the 4th Cavalry Brigade,
was subsequently Inspector of Cavalry, and, when the European War
broke out, he was given the Cavalry Division. He fought through the
Retreat from Mons and the Battle of the Marne, and after the Battle of
the Aisne was promoted to the command of the Cavalry Corps. During
the First Battle of Ypres he held the Messines ridge, filling the gap in
the line between Sir Henry Rawlinson's 7th Division and General Smith-Dorrien's
II Corps.</p>

<p>In May, 1915, he succeeded Sir Herbert Plumer in command of the
V Infantry Corps. When General Monro went to India he followed
him in command of the new Third Army on the Somme.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1916, when Sir Henry Rawlinson's Fourth Army
was formed, the Third Army was moved further north to take over the
ground around Arras vacated by the French Tenth Army under D'Urbal.
Only a small part of the right wing of Sir Edmund Allenby's Army was
engaged during the Battle of the Somme, and that only on the first day.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1916-17, apart from many brilliant trench

on Easter Monday, 1917, when Sir Edmund Allenby commanded the
right wing of the British forces in the great Battle of Arras&mdash;one of the
most successful actions as yet fought by British troops. It was his men
who carried the intricate network of trenches east of Arras, fighting their
way along the valley of the Scarpe towards Douai.</p>

<p>In June Sir Edmund Allenby was transferred to the command of
the British forces in Egypt.</p>

<p>In the European War some of the most brilliant infantry leaders
have come from the Cavalry&mdash;Haig, Gough, Kavanagh, Allenby. Sir
Edmund is a personification of the traditional qualities of an English
soldier&mdash;patient, tenacious, resolute; and his record in many fields has
shown that he possesses admirable military judgment and wide
military knowledge.</p>

HORNE, <span class="small">K.C.B.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> HENRY HORNE was born on February 19th, 1861; a son
of the late Major James Horne, of Stirkoke, Caithness. He
was educated at Harrow and Woolwich, and entered the Royal
Artillery in 1880. He served in the South African War with
distinction, and during the early stages of the European War was soon
recognised as one of the most able of our gunner Generals.</p>

<p>He went to France with Sir Douglas Haig as Brigadier-General
of Artillery of the I Corps, and took part in the Retreat from Mons,
the Battle of the Aisne and the First Battle of Ypres. He commanded
the 2nd Division during the attack at Givenchy in connection with
the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March, 1915. This Division was also
in action at the Battle of Loos in September, 1915, when it had much
desperate fighting on both sides of the La Bassée Canal.</p>

<p>In November, 1915, General Horne accompanied Lord Kitchener
to Gallipoli and was afterwards sent on to Egypt to report on the defences
of the Suez Canal. In January, 1916, he was appointed to the command
of the XV Corps in Egypt, which, in April, was transferred to the
Somme area.</p>

<p>In the first part of the battle his Corps was in action as the second
from the British right. It was his men who took Fricourt and Mametz,
assisted in the capture of Contalmaison and Bazentin le Petit, and on
September 15th triumphantly entered Flers.</p>

line between General Plumer and General Allenby.</p>

<p>In the Battle of Arras he commanded the British left. His troops
carried the Vimy ridge and fought their way to the southern and western
suburbs of Lens. Sir Henry Horne's Army had now a similar general
objective to that which his Division had had at the earlier Battle of Loos.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Horne is one of the most trusted of British soldiers.
Like the Commander-in-Chief, he is a man of few words but of many
deeds. Scotland has played a great part in the war and has contributed
more than her share of brilliant Generals. The one Scottish Army
Commander in the West has nobly sustained the traditions of his country.</p>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> WILLIAM BIRDWOOD was born on September 13th,
1865, the son of a distinguished Indian civilian. He was
educated at Clifton and at Sandhurst, and in 1883 entered
the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Two years later he went to the
Cavalry&mdash;the 12th Lancers&mdash;and a year later to the 11th Bengal
Lancers. In the South African War he rose to be Military Secretary to
Lord Kitchener, then Commander-in-Chief. In 1902 he was Assistant
Military Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief in India, and three years
later was again Lord Kitchener's Military Secretary. In 1909 he commanded
a Brigade on the Indian Frontier. In 1912 he was Quartermaster-General
in India, and later Secretary to the Government of India, Army
Department, and Member of the Viceroy's Legislative Council.</p>

<p>He has seen many campaigns besides the present. Apart from
South Africa he served in the Hazara Expedition of 1891, the Isazai
Expedition of 1892, and the Tirah Campaign of 1897-98. In South
Africa he was severely wounded, and five times mentioned in despatches.
In 1908 he was the Chief Staff officer of the Mohmand Expedition.</p>

<p>In the present war he has won an almost legendary fame as Commander
of the Anzac Corps. From that April day when they landed on
the beaches above Gaba Tepe he was the inspiration of one of the hardest
fought campaigns in all history. Wholly free from formality and red tape,
and willing to find in every soldier a man and a brother, he could yet
maintain a perfect battle discipline and keep the hearts of his men steady
under the most desperate conditions. To his cool brain, also, were due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a><br /><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a><br /><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

he carried out as Commander of the Dardanelles Army.</p>

<p>The Anzac record on the Somme was equal to their record at
Gallipoli. The capture of Pozières and Mouquet Farm was an Australian
achievement, and Flers fell to the New Zealanders. Since then, both in
the German Retreat and in the later stages of the Battle of Arras (especially
in the Hindenburg line at Bullecourt), they have shown the same fury
and steadiness in attack. An observer with them on the Somme has thus
described their behaviour:</p>

<p>"Hour after hour, day and night, with increasing intensity as the
time went on, the enemy rained heavy shell into the area. Now he would
send them crashing in on a line south of the road&mdash;eight heavy shells
at a time, minute after minute, followed by a burst of shrapnel. Now he
would place a curtain straight across this valley or that till the sky and
landscape were blotted out, except for fleeting glimpses seen as through
a lift of fog.... Day and night the men worked through it, fighting
the horrid machinery far over the horizon as if they were fighting Germans
hand to hand; building up whatever it battered down; buried some of
them, not once, but again and again and again. What is a barrage
against such troops? They went through it as you would go through
a summer shower, too proud to bend their heads, many of them, because
their mates were looking. I am telling you of things I have seen. As one
of the best of their officers said to me: 'I have to walk about as if I liked
it; what else can you do when your own men teach you to?'"</p>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> JULIAN BYNG was born on September 11th, 1862, the
seventh son of the second Earl of Strafford. He joined the 10th
Hussars in 1883, and served in the Soudan Expedition of 1884,
being present at the actions of El Teb and Tamai. In South
Africa he commanded a column with great distinction in the pursuit of
De Wet, and finished the campaign with the rank of Colonel. One of
his most successful actions was on the Vlei River, west of Reitz, where
he surprised a Boer Commando and took a 15-pounder, two pom-poms,
and many prisoners.</p>

<p>He landed in Belgium in October, 1914, in command of the
3rd Cavalry Division. He accompanied Rawlinson's 7th Division in its
retreat from Antwerp to Ypres. The doings of the famous 3rd Cavalry
Division are writ large in history, and in all the great drama of Ypres
there was no finer incident than the charge of the Household Brigade at
Klein Zillebeke on November 6th, 1914.</p>

<p>In May, 1915, General Byng succeeded General Allenby in command
of the Cavalry Corps, and was responsible for the cavalry fighting
in the later part of the Second Battle of Ypres. In August of that year
he went to the Dardanelles to take over the command of the IX Corps,
and was present during the later stages of that campaign and the famous
withdrawal from the peninsula. In February, 1916, he returned to
France to command the XVII Corps, and was transferred to the
Canadian Corps on May 24th.</p>

on the right of Sir Hubert Gough's 5th Army and did notable work,
taking Courcelette, and fighting many desperate actions on the Thiepval
Ridge. During the long stormy winter their raids on the enemy line
were among the most remarkable on the British front. More especially,
they made the section north of Arras an unquiet place for the enemy.
Their culminating achievement came at the Battle of Arras on April 9th,
1917, when they stormed in one stride four positions on the Vimy Ridge,
and wrested from the enemy the key of the plain of Douai.</p>

<p>In June Sir Julian Byng succeeded General Allenby in command
of the Third Army.</p>

<p>Sir Julian Byng has the appearance and manner of the cavalier of
tradition. No more soldierly figure has appeared in the campaign. He
has had the good fortune always to have fine troops to lead, and he is a
fit leader for the best troops. He has become to the Canadians what
General Birdwood is to the Anzacs&mdash;at once a trusted Commander and

LIEUT.-GEN. SIR WALTER NORRIS
CONGREVE, <b>V.C.</b>, <span class="small">K.C.B., M.V.O.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">IR</span> WALTER CONGREVE, born in 1862, of Chartley
and Congreve, County Stafford, was educated at Harrow and
entered the Rifle Brigade in 1885. He became a Captain in
1893, and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel in 1901. During the South
African War he won the Victoria Cross for an heroic attempt to save the
guns at Colenso&mdash;the occasion on which Lord Roberts' only son won
the same honour and lost his life.</p>

<p>During the war he received a brevet Lieut.-Colonelcy. He was
Private Secretary and Assistant Military Secretary to Lord Kitchener
when the latter was Commander-in-Chief at Pretoria.</p>

<p>After his return to England he became Commandant of the School
of Musketry at Hythe, and, on the outbreak of the European War, went
out in command of the 18th Infantry Brigade. From this he proceeded
to the command of the 6th Division, with which he was present at the
fighting at Hooge and Ypres in August and September, 1915.</p>

<p>At the Battle of the Somme he commanded the XIII Corps on the
extreme British right in liaison with the French. He was responsible for
the taking of Montauban, Bazentin and Longueval, and the desperate
fighting around Guillemont. Ill-health compelled him to relinquish his
command at the end of August, 1916, and, on his return, the XIII Corps
was moved further to the left to Sir Hubert Gough's Army.</p>

<p>General Congreve has been in command of the XIII Corps since
November 15th, 1915. His son, Brevet-Major William Congreve, The
Rifle Brigade, who fell at Longueval, July 22nd, 1916, at the age of 25,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a><br /><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a><br /><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was universally recognised as the most promising of the younger British
soldiers. In two years he had won a Brevet Majority, the D.S.O., the
Military Cross, and the Cross of the Legion of Honour, and, after
his death, he received the Victoria Cross. No family has a more
splendid fighting record.</p>

LIEUT.-GENERAL JAMES AYLMER
LOWTHORPE HALDANE, <span class="small">C.B., D.S.O.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="dropleftmid">ENERAL</span> HALDANE was born on November 17th, 1862,
of a well-known Scottish family which has given many distinguished
members to the learned professions. He was
educated at Edinburgh Academy and Sandhurst, and, in
1882, joined the Gordon Highlanders. He served in the Waziristan
Campaign of 1894; the Chitral Campaign of 1895; the Tirah Campaign
of 1897; and from 1896-99 he was A.D.C. to Sir William Lockhart.
He received the D.S.O. for his work on the Indian frontier.</p>

<p>During the South African War he fought with the 2nd Gordon
Highlanders at Elandslaagte, where he was severely wounded. He was in
command of the armoured train which was captured at Chieveley on
November 15th, 1899. The story of his escape from Pretoria after some
months' imprisonment is one of the romances of the South African
Campaign. He rejoined his battalion and was present at some of the
later actions of the war, receiving a brevet Lieut.-Colonelcy.</p>

<p>During the Russo-Japanese War he was Military Attaché with the
Japanese Army, and was present at the Battles of Liao-yang, Sha-Ho,
and Mukden.</p>

<p>He went to France in August, 1914, in command of the 10th Infantry
Brigade, which was part of the 4th Division in the III Corps. The
Brigade arrived in time for the Battle of Le Cateau, and took part in all
the subsequent fighting, being heavily engaged in the Armentières area
during the First Battle of Ypres. General Haldane was one of the first
Brigadiers to receive a Division. He succeeded Major-General Sir
Hubert Hamilton in command of the 3rd Division in October, 1914,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a><br /><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and remained with this famous Division till the Battle of the Somme.
Its heaviest fighting took place in the summer of 1915 within the Ypres
salient, and, in the spring of 1916, it was again engaged in the neighbourhood
of St. Eloi and the Bluff at Ypres.</p>

<span class="caption">LIEUT.-GEN. J. A. L. HALDANE</span>
</div>

<p>At the Battle of the Somme General Haldane took part in the great
advance of July 14th, when the 3rd Division was brilliantly successful,
carrying Bazentin le Grand, and sharing afterwards in the desperate
fighting around Longueval and Delville Wood. In August he was promoted
to the command of the VI Corps, and, during the winter, held a
portion of the Arras front. The opportunity of the Corps came in the
Battle of Arras on April 9th, 1917, when, advancing due east of the
city, its three divisions carried all their objectives, including such
formidable fortresses as the Harp and Railway Triangle, and made record
captures of prisoners and guns.</p>

<p>Few British soldiers have had a more varied experience of warfare.
He is a scholar in his profession, but his book knowledge is borne lightly,
and he has shown himself in every crisis a leader of shrewd judgment
and ample resource. He is still a young man, and, fine as his record has
been, he is universally regarded as only at the outset of his career.</p>

LIEUT.-GENERAL H. E. WATTS,
<span class="small">C.B., C.M.G.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="dropleftmid">ENERAL</span> WATTS was born on February 14th, 1858, and
entered the Army in 1880. He served in South Africa, where
he received a brevet Lieut.-Colonelcy. He became Colonel
of his regiment in 1908, and retired in 1914. On the outbreak
of the European War he returned to service, and went with General
Rawlinson to Flanders in October, 1914, in command of the 21st Brigade
of the 7th Division.</p>

<p>With this Brigade, which has seen some of the most desperate
fighting of the war, he fought at the first battle of Ypres. For three
critical days the Brigade formed one of the three which checked the whole
German advance; and then for nearly a fortnight it was in the centre
of all the bitter fighting that was directed towards Ypres. When it was
withdrawn it was but a shadow of the Brigade that had crossed Belgium
before falling back on Ypres; but in the three weeks' battle it had won
an imperishable name. General Watts fought with the Brigade on the
left of the front at Neuve Chapelle and he also took part in the summer
battles of 1915 at Festubert and Givenchy. With it he was engaged
at Loos, where the Division saw some of the most severe fighting and
where the Commander, General Capper, fell. General Watts succeeded
to General Capper's command.</p>

<p>From the first day of the battle of the Somme the 7th Division,
changed considerably in composition since the Autumn of 1914, played
a notable part. It was they who took Mametz, and they fought through
the whole of the first phase of the battle, crowning their achievement
by the capture of Bazentin le Petit. The Division was present in most
of the other great actions of the battle. In the spring of 1917 their
General received the command of a corps.</p>

<p>General Watts has a fighting reputation second to no one in the
Army. The Campaign for him has been one long Malplaquet&mdash;a hard-fought
soldiers' battle, and no man has known better how to elicit the
inherent steadfastness of British troops. To have led first a Brigade and
then a Division through some of the fiercest fights of all history is no
small record for a man on the verge of sixty years.</p>

LIEUT.-GENERAL THE RT. HON. JAN
CHRISTIAAN SMUTS, <span class="small">P.C., K.C., M.L.A.</span><br />
<span class="smaller">COMPANION OF HONOUR</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="dropleftmid">ENERAL</span> SMUTS was born on May 24th, 1870, at
Bovenplaats in the Malmesbury district of the Cape Colony,
the residence of his father, Jacobus Abraham Smuts, who
was for some time a member of the Legislative Assembly of
the Cape. He was educated at Victoria College, Stellenbosch, and graduating
with high honours in arts and science, passed as Ebden Scholar to
Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1891.</p>

<p>He secured a double first in the Law Tripos, was called to the Bar
and, returning to South Africa in 1895, was duly admitted to the Supreme
Court at Cape Town, where he began to practice his profession. He was
admitted to the Transvaal Bar in the following year, soon after the Jameson
Raid. About this time he married Miss Sibylla Krige, of Stellenbosch,
and settled in Johannesburg. He had already been mentioned as Dr.
Leyds' successor to the post of State Secretary, when in 1898 he was offered
and accepted the post of State Attorney. President Kruger's choice of so
young a man was amply and speedily justified, and his reforming zeal
exercised a formidable influence in the State.</p>

<p>It was in his capacity as State Attorney that he accompanied President
Kruger, when the latter met Lord (then Sir Alfred) Milner at Bloemfontein,
and took part in the negotiation with Mr. Conyngham Greene, the British
Agent at Pretoria. The young advocate and statesman suddenly found
his country confronted with war, and shortly after the Boer Commandos
had taken the field he was attached to General Joubert as a legal adviser
and administrative officer for the territory in Natal occupied by the
Republican forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a><br /><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Eventually, after the occupation of Pretoria by the British armies,
he received a command in the western Transvaal as Vecht-General under
General de la Rey. He proved himself a dashing and skilful commander,
and by the boldness of his movements in the Cape Colony, in the later
stages of the war, created a feeling of nervousness in Lord Kitchener's
main communications. He was in supreme command in the Cape
and was applying himself to the reduction of Ookiep when the news of the
opening of peace negotiations brought him back to the Transvaal. His
was one of the strongest voices at Vereeniging in favour of peace when
terms would still be obtainable, and when the Treaty was signed he
returned to the practice of his old profession.</p>

<p>In the interval between Vereeniging and the grant of responsible
government, he took a leading part with General Botha in restoring the
moral of the Boer people, which had suffered severely in the disastrous
war, and also in preparing them for self-government.</p>

<p>When, in 1907, responsible government was granted to the Transvaal,
General Smuts assumed the portfolio of Colonial Secretary in General
Botha's Ministry, and continued the work of national reconstruction and
reconciliation between the two races and was largely responsible for the
holding of the conferences on closer union which eventually culminated
in the National Convention at which the South Africa Act, the Constitution
of the Union, was framed.</p>

<p>He held successively the portfolios of Defence, the Interior, Mines,
and Finance in General Botha's First Union Cabinet, and amongst other
legislative activities was responsible for the South African Defence Act,
the machinery of which was severely tested in the Syndicalist strikes at
Johannesburg of 1913 and 1914, and the unfortunate rebellion in the
latter portion of that year and also the campaign in South West Africa.</p>

<p>In March, 1916, Lieut.-General Smuts arrived in British East Africa
and assumed command of the East African Expeditionary Force upon the
pressing request of the Imperial Government and in succession to General
Smith-Dorrien, who had been compelled to relinquish the command
owing to a severe illness. Within a year he had driven the German troops
from British territory, reduced them by two-thirds, and penned them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
into the southern and south-western malarial area with its one healthy
spot at Mahenge.</p>

<p>General Smuts is still a young man, though he has had exceptional
experience. A scholar by taste, a lawyer by profession, and perforce a
soldier, he represents a unique figure in the Empire. The boldness and
energy of his leading as a General seem to suggest the born commander.
As Statesman, his conceptions reveal an intuitive grasp of the fundamental
ideals that must guide the present and inspire the future.</p>

  <p>"It is a matter for thankfulness that the authorities were
  able to secure the services of so distinguished an artist as Mr.
  Muirhead Bone to depict for us the conditions in the war zone
  of the Western Front. To give not only the thing seen but
  the spirit lying within it, that is the province of the imaginative
  and selective artist. And that is what Mr. Bone has done
  with a measure of success that almost defies exaggerated
  praise. He brings to his task the technique of a master and
  the vision of a true artist."&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

  <p>"Mr. Muirhead Bone has clearly justified the action of
  H.M. Government in employing him as an official artistic
  chronicler of the greatest of all wars."&mdash;<i>Burlington Magazine.</i></p>

  <p>"Mr. Muirhead Bone's vigorous drawings of the toil and
  moil of British warfare and all its circumstantial splendour
  and squalor stand in no further need of commendation....
  It is a noble and enduring achievement.... These two
  drawings alone assure Lieutenant Bone's place among the
  immortals."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

  <p>"Mr. Bone's drawings convey an extraordinary idea of the
  abomination and desolation caused by shell fire."&mdash;<i>Field.</i></p>

  <p>"The drawings are of endless interest in their subjects and
  excite a natural wonder at the artist's remarkable fertility and
  versatility. It is impossible to overestimate the value of these
  drawings as a record of the actualities of the war."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

  <p>"The selection of Mr. Bone is triumphantly justified by his
  terrific Tank drawing, which no one's romantic exaggeration&mdash;not
  Doré's or Hugo's even&mdash;could have made more overwhelming
  in its onset or more deadly."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

  <p>"Whether it be a speaking drawing of a road liable to be
  shelled, or a V.A.D. rest station, or German prisoners coming
  down from the front, or, again, the finished sketch of Amiens
  Cathedral with the aeroplanes round the spire, or a hospital
  ship scene at the quayside, all give a permanent impression of
  war scenes and war conditions which can hardly be too highly
  commended."&mdash;<i>Bookseller.</i></p>

  <p>"Among the little aristocracy of war pictures, destined to
  have permanent value both as history and as art, must certainly
  be placed the drawings of Mr. Muirhead Bone."&mdash;<i>Coventry</i>
  Herald.</p>

  <p>"The Work grows on us."&mdash;<i>Liverpool Post.</i></p>

  <p>"In selecting Mr. Muirhead Bone for the task of depicting
  the varied scenes of activity on the British Front in France
  and Flanders, the Government have shown a very wise choice,
  which has been justified by the excellent series of drawings
  now being published."&mdash;<i>Broad Arrow.</i></p>

  <p>"It cannot be too strongly said that no mere photographic
  record can ever approach the great work Mr. Bone is doing in
  these sketches.&mdash;<i>Montrose Standard.</i>"</p>

  <p>"The Series will certainly be greatly prized."&mdash;<i>Army and
  Navy Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"An eloquent pencil, a dashing stroke, guided by a discerning
  brain, and the art of perspective are the requisites for
  a successful portrayal of the varied scenes of every battlefield,
  and these qualities Mr. Bone possesses to admiration."&mdash;<i>Aberdeen
  Journal.</i></p>

  <p>"Of all the records of the war up to date this publication
  alone conveys something of the impressiveness that fighting
  on the present scale might be expected to give."&mdash;<i>Manchester
  Weekly Times.</i></p>

  <p>"Mr. Bone's work was needed. Now that I have seen his
  picture books I know more about the war. A poet with a
  line of verse, a cunning draughtsman with a few strokes of
  the pencil on paper, can tell you what you will never learn
  from Blue Books and histories. I begin to understand this
  tremendous war."&mdash;The Londoner in the <i>Evening News</i>.</p>

  <p>"Among the drawings are some of extraordinary power
  and interest made by the artist in British munition factories."&mdash;<i>Westminster
  Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"Dozens of Artists have drawn ships. Mr. Bone has interpreted
  them. He has done the Fleet a great service in bringing
  it thus intimately to the Landsmen. The drawings will rank
  for all time among the world's greatest treasures in nautical
  art."&mdash;<i>Country Life.</i></p>

  <p>"Will take a foremost place among the permanent records

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> central figure of this second portrait gallery of British
Generals is that of Lord French, who gives a unity and
atmosphere to the collection. The phase of the War he
represents is quite distinct, indeed unique. The Army with
which his name will ever be associated was an admittedly incomparable
force, and many of the Generals whose portraits are to be found here
went through the greatest ordeal of our history with him.</p>

<p>There have been many crises in the war. There will yet be others.
But none can compare with that first four months in which the first issue
was victory or defeat, and the second the coast or annihilation. Earlier
wars have given a phraseology that endures till now of the processes by
which campaigns are won. Armies are "decimated," and the term is
taken to be synonymous with defeat. But this term is wholly inadequate
to describe the price at which Sir John French and his troops redeemed
the Channel coast. Little of the first Army was left when the first four
months had passed, but the Kaiser's legions had not secured a decision;
they had been cheated of the coast; and they had learned a lesson which
will endure.</p>

<p>But at the end of this episode the great crisis had passed. The
cloud which had overhung our Army had lifted. The light began to
shine and anxious eyes could dimly see the promise of a fairer day. It
is the first days of the war when the British troops went blithely to
their awful tryst that must ever be the fire and inspiration of the generations
to come. They are still more obscure than any other period of the
war and they were more highly charged with emotion than perhaps any
days can be expected to equal, unless it be those last days when the Allied
troops shall drive the enemy from the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans had secretly concentrated behind their screen of
cavalry in Belgium. Sordets' cavalry had made a gallant raid through
the country without gaining any sure information of where the main
enemy forces lay. The French had made tentative moves eastward
without finding any great force in their path. So the third week of the
war dawned with no trustworthy evidence of the existence of that huge
force that was to make its gallop to Paris. In such circumstances Sir
John French landed with his staff. The Allies were groping in the dark
and the British Army was cast for a rôle that it never had a chance of
performing. Suddenly the German force emerged from behind its
concealing curtain of horse. Without any trace of hesitation it moved
westward over Belgium. Everything was in its place. Uniforms were
new and fresh. Every scientific aid was in use, and the whole superstructure
of the Allied strategy began to disappear. But <i>only the superstructure</i>.</p>

<p>It seems strange now to state that the rôle of the British Army was
to outflank the German right wing. With our present knowledge of
the sequence of events it is difficult to think that it was ever possible.
The German Army had been trained for speed, and the German policy
was based on getting in the first blow. When it fell it found the Allies
unprepared. A full half-million picked German troops marched across
Belgium on the 20th and 21st of August; but when the first encounters
began on the Sambre the British Armies were not in their positions.
The first Allied plan was already impracticable before the British Army
took its place about Mons and prepared to give battle. The Sambre
line could be no longer maintained; but the British commander, not yet
notified of the fact, set himself to the forlorn hope of forbidding the
advance of an army many times greater than his own force.</p>

<p>The Battle of Mons was decided before it had begun; and the troops
who were compelled to retreat had planned quite another sort of episode.
Sir John French and his Generals had to retire in haste from the peril
of being surrounded and cut off.</p>

<p>At some phases of long drawn out war of positions it was forgotten
that the Army which first took the field had to face the war of movements,
and that only their astounding skill and courage enabled them to cope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
with it in its worst aspect. German generals have recently proclaimed
their belief that the British Army will not be able to succeed in open
warfare. Bernhardi even said that he doubted if the troops could face
a European army. But this latter statement was made before the war,
and it has perished in the light of numerous German defeats. The former
can never survive our recollection of the conduct of the most difficult
operations in open warfare by Sir John French and his Generals. An
enforced retreat is a more searching test of military skill than any that
is known to soldiers, and it was such an experience that met the British
Army on the threshold of the War.</p>

<p>At Mons the Army made retreat possible. The battle was not of
long duration; but it was sufficient to put an end to Bernhardi's hopes.
The fierce onset of the Germans was broken by the amazing skill and
coolness of a numerically inferior army, provided with hardly any of the
instruments which were to give the tone to the war. Yet the few British
machine guns and the incomparable riflemen inflicted losses that had
never been expected by the enemy. German officers have explained
their amazement at seeing the cool unhurried firing after the troops had
been hammered time and again with an overwhelming weight of
artillery.</p>

<p>They had scarcely any cover; but when the bombardment was over
the quiet orders were instantly obeyed and the men met the enemy as
though on man&oelig;uvres. Dispositions had been carefully made and the
Germans met a deadly check. But this skill and courage was called upon
more searchingly in the retreat which followed. The Germans seemed
to be round both their wings. Indeed the first few days were fought in
certainly what must have appeared to be partial envelopment. Le
Cateau was a rearguard battle, such as perhaps has never been fought in
history before. The men were too tired to do anything but put their
fortunes to the final test; and, though overwhelmed by shrapnel, they
won through. Courage alone cannot explain such a feat. Experience
and the coolness that is born of it only explains half; the skill of the
commanders could alone have justified the decision to stand at such
hazards and could alone have brought the men through them. Le
Cateau was won by the better troops. The British were moved back;
but the check they administered gave them breathing space for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The proportions of the force they had to meet were now clearer to
the British commanders. By the Marne they had taken a surer measure.
On the Aisne they put their judgment to the test and the successes of the
First Corps in winning to the crest of the ridge, but lately cleared by the
French, shewed that their reading of the situation was correct. Yet they
were still to go through the final ordeal. They were taken north and set
to tasks that were again incommensurate with their force. The army was
still smaller than that of Belgium; and yet they were encouraged to look
forward to Bruges, whence great German reinforcements were at that
moment hastening south. Part of the army was falling back towards
Ypres, and before this peaceful old Belgian town one of the decisive
battles of history gradually emerged.</p>

<p>How the British Army survived Ypres is one of the mysteries upon
which time can throw little light. But how it saved Ypres and survived
at the same time can only be known from an investigation into the courage
and surpassing skill of the splendid organism which had our honour in
its keeping. The endurance under a ceaseless battering, the repeated
readjustments that were necessitated by the mere weight of the onslaught,
the mere mechanism of carrying on from day to day under such a strain
can only be explained by a tribute to skilful handling that needs no
emphasis. Officers acted with an insistent recognition of the issues at
stake. The line, momentarily breached at Gheluvelt, was immediately
restored before the orders of the supreme command could direct the
operation. But this was only one great example of the skill that found
expression everywhere and all the time.</p>

<p>Many of these generals, whose lives shine but vaguely through the
facts which outline them, fought through these days of trial. All of them
had other and stranger experience under other suns; but the experience
they had garnered met its supreme test in the first phase of the war.
When it had passed the barque of the army had ridden the troubled
waters and was safe in harbour with only its terrible wounds to bear
witness to the ordeal it had survived. Some of the commanders were
fighting in other climes and came to the decisive theatre of the war when
the great crisis had passed. They and all are part of the country's
patrimony, part of its insurance of victory. They form a striking <i>ensemble</i>.
Guardsmen some of them, with the halo which surrounds that name since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the war began; engineers others, with the cool and calculating craftsmanship
of their kind; others, again, of the artillery with bitter memories of
the numerical weakness of their arm in the hour of trial and yet remembering
fierce and glorious hours at Le Cateau, where they stood to the service
of their guns and did the work of ten times their number. And there is
not wanting a representative of the newest arm&mdash;the air service, which
have many things to teach soldiers yet.</p>

<p>They are one in that goodly fellowship of great soldiers who have
come through the fire of the fiercest battles in the world's history. We
can glimpse their metal in their actions. We have recently seen how
potent still is the skill which directs in the face of all scientific and
mechanical development of the war. It is natural for us who read daily
the record of our soldiers to be more conscious of their small failures,
than of their great success. But trace the broad lines of the war, retread
those trampled roads of northern France once more behind the armies
these men led, remember their mastery in the darkest days and their
record becomes luminous with the assurance of final victory.</p>

FIELD-MARSHAL VISCOUNT FRENCH
OF YPRES, <span class="small">K.P., G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G.</span></h2>

<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="dropleftmax">ORD</span> FRENCH'S name will descend to posterity as the leader of
the British Expeditionary Force. Were all his other great
services to his country reckoned as naught, his name would
live for ever by reason of the German Emperor's vainglorious
allusion to "French's contemptible little army." For, as long as the
British Empire shall endure, men will hold in honour "the old Contemptibles,"
who shattered for ever an Emperor's dreams of world
supremacy and made his boast recoil upon his head.</p>

<p>John Denton Pinkstone French comes of one of the most ancient
Irish families, the Frenches of Galway and Roscommon, of whom Lord
French of French Park, Roscommon, is the head. The Field-Marshal
is fifth in descent from John French, M.P., who fought in the army of
William III. and commanded a troop of Enniskillen Dragoons at
Aughrim in 1689. His grandfather left Ireland at the beginning of the
XIXth century and settled in Kent at Ripple Vale, near Deal, where, on
September 28th, 1852, Lord French of Ypres was born.</p>

<p>Lord French's father was Captain John French, R.N., who retired
from the service with the rank of Post Captain and died when the boy,
his only son, was but two years old. Upon his mother, a Scottish lady,
a Miss Eccles from the neighbourhood of Glasgow, devolved the upbringing
of the infant son and his five sisters. After a brief sojourn at
Harrow, the boy was sent to Eastman's School at Portsmouth to prepare
for the Navy. In 1866, in his fourteenth year, he entered the "Britannia,"
and thence passed out as a midshipman.</p>

<p>At the age of 18, young John French sought the advice of a family
friend and decided to make the change which was destined to alter the
whole course of his life. He entered the militia and spent two years in
the Garrison Artillery at Ipswich (1871 to 1873). Then he passed into
the regular army, being gazetted, at the age of 21, to the 8th Hussars,
with whom, however, he remained only a short time, transferring, after
a few weeks, to the 19th Hussars, the regiment with which he passed the
first half of his life as a soldier.</p>

<p>In 1880 Captain French became Adjutant of the Northumberland
Yeomanry, and was thus, to his great disappointment, prevented from
accompanying his regiment, the 19th, to Egypt in 1882. However, his
chance came two years later when he went out as second in command of
the 19th to join Wolseley's Nile Expedition. French was at Abu
Klea and in the subsequent desperate fighting, and he was actually the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a><br /><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a><br /><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
first man of the column to learn, from the lips of Stuart Wortley, of the
fall of Khartum and the death of Gordon. For his good work in Egypt
French was mentioned in despatches and returned to England as
Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>

<span class="caption">FIELD-MARSHAL VISCOUNT FRENCH</span>
</div>

<p>Five years of garrison duty followed. In 1891 Col. French took the
19th Hussars out to India, being stationed first at Secunderabad and
afterwards at Bangalore. In 1893 he returned to England and retired
on half-pay. In the following year he was entrusted with the compilation
of the Cavalry Drill-book, and 1895 found him installed at the War Office
as Deputy-Adjutant-General under Sir Redvers Buller.</p>

<p>From now on French rose rapidly in his profession. As commander
of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade at Canterbury (1897), and the 1st Cavalry
Brigade at Aldershot (1898), he had ample scope to elaborate his theories
on cavalry training. None was more tenacious than French of maintaining
the "cavalry spirit" in the British Cavalry, but he had recognized
in Egypt the advantages of teaching the cavalry to fight dismounted as
well. His theories were violently combated, but his justification was at
hand. The time was approaching when he was to burst into prominence
as England's main hope in South Africa.</p>

<p>Lord French was given command of the cavalry in Natal, and landed
in South Africa on October 12th, 1899, the day after the declaration of
war. He returned to England in July, 1902, with an almost unbroken
record of successes in the campaign to his name.</p>

<p>His next command was the 1st Army Corps at Aldershot. Here for
five years he worked at high pressure with the watch-word of "Efficiency."
From Aldershot French was summoned by Lord Haldane, then Secretary
of State for War, and given the appointment of Inspector-General of the
Forces. In this post he laid the bases of the Expeditionary Force and of
the Territorial Army which was to prove its valuable auxiliary in the
years to come. In 1911 he was appointed Chief of the Imperial General
Staff and held this appointment until 1914, when he resigned.</p>

<p>From his retirement he was summoned to take command of the
Expeditionary Force. He left London on the afternoon of Friday,
August 14th, and landed in France that evening. For sixteen months
he remained at the head of the British Army in France, which he watched
expand from the four Divisions of the Retreat from Mons into a vast
army of a million men. In December, 1915, he was recalled to take up
the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces. At the New Year,
1916, he was created a Viscount.</p>

<p>In the title he assumed the Field-Marshal has commemorated the
sternest battle he fought across the Channel. Ypres was the supreme test.
When the full history of the war comes to be written, the Empire will
realize how much it owes its security to the high patriotism and indomitable
tenacity of the Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force.</p>
